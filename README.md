# Python Learning Progress

Welcome to my personal repository where I document my journey and progress in learning Python programming. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) showcasing the concepts, projects, and exercises I work on as I continue to improve my skills.

## Repository Structure

- **`PythonComplete/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with Python code, explanations, and results of various exercises.
- **`Projects/`**: (Soon to be added) A folder for any larger projects or mini-projects completed as part of the learning journey.

## Notebooks

Each notebook in the `PythonComplete/` sub-folders is organized by topic and contains:

- **Concepts**: Explanation of the Python concepts covered.
- **Code Examples**: Python code snippets and exercises.
- **Results**: Outputs and results from running the code.
- **Notes**: Personal notes and reflections on the learning process.

## Learning Goals

- **Basic Python Syntax**: Understanding variables, data types, and basic operations.
- **Control Flow**: Learning about loops, conditionals, and error handling.
- **Functions and Modules**: Creating reusable functions and working with modules.
- **Data Structures**: Mastering lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Exploring classes, objects, and inheritance.
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: Working with popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

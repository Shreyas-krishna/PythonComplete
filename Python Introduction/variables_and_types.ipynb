    "<h3>Variables and Types</h3>\n",
    "<p>Everything that the program needs, data and the program itself, is stored somewhere in the computer's memory. A variable is a location in computer memory to which we assign a meaningful name, into which we can place values. When a variable is created with a name, python allocates a memory location for the value it holds. Python knows to refer to this memory location whenever the name associated with that location is used i.e. the variable's name. Python also decides the type of the variable depending on the value we assign to it, it ensures only that operations which can be performed on the variable type can be applied to it.\n",

    "-> python variable names must begin with a character.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> variable name may contain alphabets or numerical values but do not begin with numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> the character underscore(_) is used in place of a space to seperate two words in a variable  \n",
    "   name e.g. first_name.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> python variables are case sensitive i.e. the variable name 'a' and another variable with the \n",
    "   name 'A' are two different memory location.\n",

    "-> we can bind a value to a variable by the use the '=' operator.</p>"

There are different types of data types built into python, some examples being string, integers etc. We can check the type a variable by calling the method 'type()'. Data type(type) in python describes the kind of information that we are storing as a variable. It's more accurate to think of the value bound to a variable as having a type, rather than the variable itself.</p>"
